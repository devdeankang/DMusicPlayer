# DMusicPlayer
Music player app for iOS and Android created using Xamarin Forms.

Xamarin Forms is a cross-platform development system used to make native mobile apps using C# and XAML.
To test the effectiveness of Forms I decided to create an app which utilizes a lot of OS specific functionality, thus, a music player.

By utilizing platform specific features I was successfully able to create a functional music player and playlist creator app which has a natural feel on both platforms.

Features include:
* Playing songs
* Song progress bar with seeking capabilities
* Creating playlists
* Adding songs to playlists
* Adding songs to queue
* Shuffling queue
* Lockscreen controls
* Notification controls
